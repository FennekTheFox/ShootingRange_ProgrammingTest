#ShootingRange Programming Test

The task:
Make a shooter range project with weapons that can swap out ammunition types and weapon mods. Make targets that can be hit and may give different points depending on where they were hit.

The project was created with an unmodified version of Unreal Engine 5.3.2

My thoughts on the task:
For a programming test that's a pretty big time investment... the simplicity of the task hides the complexity of the individual systems that need to be created. Furthermore, making a good "shooter range" tests certain things that arent relevant, like access to assets and setting up Animation Blueprints. In case of the latter, thats usually a Technical Artist's domain, and while I could've done it, it would have taken a whole lot of time.... so i apologize that the character moves like a stick and doesnt properly align the weapon with where the third person crosshair is located.
